Problem Statement:
1. Create an account and login to the application.
2. Create a new itinerary by specifying a destination, travel dates, and a list of activities and
accommodations to include in the itinerary.
3. View and edit their existing itineraries.
4. View a list of suggested activities and accommodations based on their destination and travel dates, using data from a third-party API. 
5. Add, remove, and reorder activities and accommodations in their itinerary.
6. View a summary of their itinerary, including the total cost of activities and accommodations.
7. Share their itinerary with friends or travel companions by generating a unique URL that can be accessed by anyone with the link.
The application should be built using React for the frontend, Express and Node.js for the backend, and should store data in a MongoDB database.
To optimize the performance of the application, the server should implement caching to store the results of frequently-used API calls. This should involve designing an appropriate caching strategy and algorithm to determine which API calls should be cached and for how long.The application should also include appropriate validation and error handling, as well as server-side input validation to protect against malicious input.
